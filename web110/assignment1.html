    <p>Traceroute is a tool that helps internet users find internet connection problems while navigating on the web, when having trouble trying to connect to the web, you can run the traceroute from your computer and it will show you path traffic between your device and the web that you are trying to reach. It is a reality that people encounter a large number of problems when using the internet and sometimes we do not know what the issue is, it could be the local router, the internet service provider, the network etc; so what we typically do is that we call a technician so they can fix the problem. Now that I know how to run the Traceroute, it will be easy for me to locate where is the problem coming from in a very efficient way, I will be applying this method everytime I encounter some of this problems.  </p>
